# Laravel Learning Playground 🎓

This repository is **not a live production site** — it's a personal learning environment where I’m exploring:

- 🔧 Laravel (PHP framework)
- 💻 GitHub Codespaces
- 🌐 Route → Controller → View concepts
- 🎨 Blade templating, layouts, and Bootstrap theming

---

## 🚀 View My Laravel Practice Site

> ⚠️ This preview is **only accessible while my Codespace is active**:

🔗 [Laravel Learning Preview (about page)](https://didactic-guacamole-g4rv6wv5q6q4fg7x-8000.app.github.dev/about)

> If the link doesn’t work or asks you to log in, it means the Codespace isn’t running or is private to me.

## 🛠️ Why This Isn’t Publicly Hosted on GitHub Pages

This Laravel app is built in **PHP**, which GitHub Pages **does not support natively** (it only serves static files like HTML/CSS/JS).

To run PHP and Laravel:

- I use **GitHub Codespaces**, which lets me spin up a full development server in the cloud.
- The live preview links (like the one above) are **temporary** and **require Codespaces access** to work.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is strictly a practice environment, not meant for production or public hosting.  
It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with Laravel structure, Bootstrap styling, and full-stack workflows.

## 📚 Topics I'm Practicing

- Laravel MVC basics
- Blade templates and layouts
- Bootstrap and custom CSS integration
- Local dev using `php artisan serve`
