## 🚀 Laravel Learning Site (Public Preview)
🟢 **Now Public! You can preview it here:**  
🔗 [Laravel Practice Site – About Page](https://didactic-guacamole-g4rv6wv5q6q4fg7x-8000.app.github.dev/about)
> ⚠️ This link will only work if the Codespace is running and port 8000 is open to the public.

## 🛠️ Why It’s Not Hosted on GitHub Pages
This Laravel app is written in **PHP**, which needs a backend server.  
GitHub Pages only supports **static files** (HTML, CSS, JS). That’s why we use **GitHub Codespaces** to run Laravel.
---
## 📌 Disclaimer
This is a **learning-only** Laravel setup — not meant for public deployment or live production.  
It’s a practice sandbox for MVC, layouts, CSS theming, and Codespaces workflows.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
