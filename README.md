# Laravel Learning Playground 🎓 ![Learning Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Learning%20Project-pink)

This repository is **not a live production site** — it's a personal learning environment where I'm exploring:

- 🔧 Laravel (PHP framework)
- 💻 GitHub Codespaces

## 🚀 Laravel Learning Site (Public Preview)

🟢 **Now Public! You can preview it here:**  
🔗 [Laravel Practice Site – About Page](https://didactic-guacamole-g4rv6wv5q6q4fg7x-8000.app.github.dev/about)

> ⚠️ This link will only work if the Codespace is running and port 8000 is set to public.

## 🛠️ Why It’s Not Hosted on GitHub Pages

This Laravel app is written in **PHP**, which requires a backend server to run.  
GitHub Pages only supports **static content** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), so `.php` files won't run there.

That's why I’m using **GitHub Codespaces** to spin up a Laravel server in the cloud.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a **learning-only Laravel setup** — not meant for public deployment or live production.  
It’s a practice sandbox for Laravel MVC, Blade templating, custom CSS, and Codespaces workflow.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
